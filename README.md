## 🚀 Features
✔️ Calculates factorial of any non-negative integer

✔️ Validates user input

✔️ Supports both iterative and/or recursive implementation (optional)

✔️ Clean and readable C# code

✔️ Beginner-friendly structure
How It Works
The program asks the user to enter a number, then computes its factorial using a simple algorithm (loop or recursion)
